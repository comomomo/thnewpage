	<p> <b>  Gearhart Walk - 2014 </b> </p>
	
	<p> Gearhart Walk is a 3d representation in Unity of a path along the Oregon coast I've grown up visiting. Using references from Google Maps and my memory of the location I put the scene together halfway accross the United States in Chicago. The Oregon Coast's forceful weather keeps the shape of the physical beach in constant flux. This reconstruction preserves a spatial memory of the place in a static embedded environment. Lossy transcription through reference photos and idealization result in a dry yet gentle virtual world.</p>

	<p> Gearhart Walk uses the Unity webplayer plugin which Chrome is no longer friendly with. I recommend finding another browser to view it and doing so in fullscreen.</p>
