    Markmaker is a drawing app using Project Tango hardware to allow users to mark their environments in Augmented Reality. Markmaker features drawing according to the orientation of the surface, color picking, gallery viewing and editing. Drawings may be exported from the gallery as colored OBJ files for sharing online or usage in other 3d environments.

<b>Privacy Policy</b>
<p>
    Markmaker for Project Tango on Google Play Store requires access to camera for the augmented reality effect in the "new drawing" mode. While creating new drawings or editing old drawings, Markmaker automatically saves a file called autoback.mmsave to the Markmaker application folder. Users can also manually save .mmsave files to the Markmaker application folder. Users can also load and modify these files later in the "gallery" section of the application. Users may then export their models to OBJ files into the Markmaker application folder. To save, export, and load files Markmaker requires the read / write permissions in Android. Markmaker for Project Tango does not access any information outside of the Markmaker folder. Markmaker also allows users to easily share models through email in the gallery. Markmaker's interaction with the email client is limited to an intent function which attaches an OBJ file and its file path to the body of a new email.
