<p>The GIF format is just another piece of media that's always had the capability of artistic expression. I would argue that like the GIF almost anything has the potential to be used to express ideas. After all, paint, one of the most prevelant art forms, is simply a thick amount of coloring usually transferred to a canvas using a paintbrush. At its rawest form painting seems somewhat banal. What the combination of colors, a brush and a canvas has proven is nearly endless expression. Work that focuses heavily on depicting reality in painstaking detail or work that breaks apart reality or examines what that reality means emotionally or physically. Then work that explores different ideologies like paintings of jesus or simple appreciations of form through works like "the starry night." All of this happens through the action of placing paint on a canvas.<p>

<p>As we've shifted into a more digital era, we've pushed paintings into image files and broadcast them across the internet. Those strokes of color on canvas have been converted into pixels to be read on monitors. Almost anyone on the internet can access the same images of art, be it paint or sculpture. The GIF is a piece of media born of the internet. Even with its basic beginnings with explosions and area closed signs the GIF was being used to express ideas in different ways. Simple language like "this website is closed" and "this website is dangerous" were already being communicated through the new media.<p>

<p>By itself the GIF isn't all that much, a simple container for images in sequence. What it holds in its potential like the combination of paint and canvas expands with the human imagination and craving for communication and outreach in a time where both can reach audiences across the world with extreme efficiency.<p>
