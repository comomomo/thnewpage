I would agree with Kirby's statement that Everything is a Remix. In his series <i>Everything is a Remix</i>, Kirby discusses the ownership of ideas. He does this mostly through the lenses of technology and media. He explores the adoption of lyrics from Jazz into Heavy Metal, war and western films into Star Wars and then transitions into the movement of technology. He looks at ways ink and motors informed the printing press and how the gui evolved from its conception in research into what we know today. Kirby in this way draws the focus of remixing into the creation of objects or culture.
</p>

<p>
I would also push that statement further to say that we are influenced by our surroundings in the same way. The way a family raises a child in the context of its surroundings forms sets of ideals which later develop as their surroundings shift. For example, warrior cultures might raise their people to value the survival of their tribe while the individual might be the core of another culture. The lenses we see through shape how we filter in the world and how we evolve as people. We're complicated remixes in our own rite. 	
</p>

<p>
The way that we transcribe those thoughts and ideas through tools and art media result in those physical manifestations Kirby refers to. It comes back to the ideas established early in Nick Briz's Wired II Class: That no technology is neutral nor unpolitical. Tools and media as they're created and remixed manifest the politics of their creator. 
</p>

<p>
For example, Kirby Ferguson uses documentary video in <i>Everything is a Remix</i> to explore the nature of evolution through remixing and the things limiting remixing in our current culture. As someone invested in the state of creative content, his documentary serves to inform and to work to restore an open system for free thought through its closing remarks on patents. 
</p>

<p>
To contrast this, David Gelb uses documentary video in <i>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</i> to explore the culture of a sushi restaurant called Sukiyabashi Jiro in Japan. <i>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</i> doesn't look at remixing in the same way Kirby does. Nor does it explore something as vast as the evolution of human technology. In this way Gelb and Ferguson prove that documentary video as a medium or use of technology can create vastly different lenses. 
</p>

<p>
Both directors coming from different backgrounds or seeing different issues to address use the film format differently. 
</p>

<p>
So I agree wholeheartedly with Kirby that <i>Everything is a Remix</i>. Everything in this way includes us as people, technology and media transcribe the remixes of a person and the remixes of themselves.
