Out of the "9 design ideas that forever changed the web" I'd say the graphics user interface has held the most impact over the years.

Without the graphics user interface the internet as we know it wouldn't exist.
The graphics user interface has opened the internet to a greater population of people, established a framework for most of what users know as the internet today, and is used almost universally in commercial computing.

The graphics user interface translates a language for computers into a language for people. 
Instead of displaying cluttered code and demanding a thorough knowledge of commands for the computer, the graphics user interface simplifies actions into visual buttons. 
Using a visual language, the graphics user interface offers opportunities for a more universally approachable internet.
Symbols surround in our physical world through road signs, advertisements, logos, and more.
Since the graphics user interface offers the ability to add symbols to work the internet is far more approachable by anyone with an understanding of standard symbols rather than convuluded commands.
This expanded demographic has largely shaped the internet.
To get a solid idea of the internet's varied population one might look to facebook; one of the most populated sites on the internet. 
According to this guardian article (http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/04/facebook-10-years-mark-zuckerberg) Facebook in Feburary of 2014 recorded 1.23 billion users. 
On facebook users of varying education, age, and wealth can connect with one another from most developed or developing countries in the world thanks to the universal language of symbols and it's approachable interface.
The graphics user interface has enabled usage of a universal language to translate from code to a more human dialog.

The graphics user interface has shaped the internet's demographics and it's visual form. 
The 9 design ideas that forever changed the web, the gif, user centered design, net art, svgs, infographics, embeddable fonts and responsive web design exist in a user interface on the internet.
Each of these concepts could exist on their own but would be vastly simplified. 
The gif can exist by itself but looks absurd without the framework of websites.
This is best demonstrated in Anthony Antonellis' internet art site "Public Domain" where they are placed into frames without any UI to explain their existance. http://www.anthonyantonellis.com/publicdomain/
SVG's are commonly used on websites where logos are necessary and in certain web art sites. 
The infographic is largely used on social networking sites which might not exist without the univeral language of a GUI.
Embeddable fonts and responsive web design both exist to improve the user interface of websites.
All of these fall under a user centered design which the graphics user interface exemplifies through its easing of access. 

Because of its wide usage, easing of access to the internet, and it's framework for the internet as we know it, I chose the graphics user interface as the most important design innovation for the internet.
